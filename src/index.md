# Ciao a tutti!

My name is John Amador, but I mainly go by Javi.<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> I'm currently a student at San Francisco State University (Go Gators!), pursuing my BS in Business Administration with a concentration in Management. I grew up in Manila, studied for a bit at Bocconi University, Milan in Italy, and now am in the beautiful Bay Area.

<div class="sidenote-container">
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">
        Pronounced as "Ha-vi," sort of like Javier but shorter. Just a nickname I had since I was a kid, but everyone calls me that instead of John. || [Ëˆxabi] You can use http://ipa-reader.xyz to hear how it's pronounced if ever too!

Feel free to check out my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javi-amador/). I'm down to talk about almost anything and everything under the sun. My main interests are sports of almost every kind, the commercial aviation industry, public transit, housing, and the automotive industry. I'm a Liverpool, AC Milan, Sacramento Kings, LA Dodgers, and LA Chargers supporter, and yeah I know that's a weird mix of teams, but always willing to answer why.

This site is still a work in progress, and I'm hoping eventually to have a little blog for where I can talk about whatever comes to mind!
