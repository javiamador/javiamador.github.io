# One Year On

On January 23, 2024 while playing pick-up football (soccer for some of you), I was tackled and heard a loud pop in my knee. I've had injuries before in my more than a decade of playing football but I knew in the back of my mind, even with all the hope I had, that whatever happened to me was bad. My friends tried to help me up and walk but I couldn't even put any weight on my right leg, much less stand. My right leg would bow inwards at the knee so with my rudimentary knowledge of Sports Science from 2 years of IB, I thought it was my MCL that I tore, but after an excruciating few days, awkwardly moving from bed, to bathroom, to car, hospital, mri, etc, I found out that I had a clean complete tear of my right ACL, with some very minor meniscus tearing as well.<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label>

Here's a paragraph with a sidenote.<label for="sn-post1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
